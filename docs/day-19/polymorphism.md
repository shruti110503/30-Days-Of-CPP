## What is Polymorphism?
The word “polymorphism” means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

## Types of Polymorphism-
1) Compile-time Polymorphism- This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
2) Runtime Polymorphism- This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding. Late binding and dynamic polymorphism are other names for runtime polymorphism. The function call is resolved at runtime in runtime polymorphism.

## Advantages of Polymorphism
Polymorphism in C++ allows for:

1) Code reusability: Write code that works with objects of different classes.
2) Method overriding: Redefine base class methods in derived classes.
3) Dynamic binding: Decide at runtime which method to invoke.
4) Abstract interfaces: Define interfaces for different classes to implement.
